## Essay


This article explains that, according to a recent AI-based analysis of brush strokes, a very famous painting by Rubens exhibited in London's National Gallery is very likely to be a fake.

If true, this revelation raises two questions: first, how did a fake painting end up being displayed in the National Gallery? And secondly, what steps should the curators now take regarding the painting?

The first issue casts doubt on the authenticity of all works-of-art in all museums across the globe, and therefore on my own aesthetic experiences and memories: how many of them are based on fakes? 

The second one is clear-cut: the curators should tell the truth and flag the painting as probably not painted by Rubens.
